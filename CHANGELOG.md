## [2.0.0](https://github.com/Gusarovv/discord-card-canvas/compare/v1.4.4...v2.0.0) (2024-11-28)

### ðŸš€ Breaking Changes:

- **Custom Fonts Support:**
  - The library no longer includes preloaded fonts.
  - Added full support for custom font loading with the `loadFont` and `loadFonts` utility methods.
    > Example:
    > ```typescript
    > loadFont('./fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf', { family: 'Roboto', weight: '700', style: 'normal' });
    > ```
  - This change allows you to use any font you prefer, providing greater flexibility and reducing library size.

### âœ¨ New Features:

- **Enhanced TextCard Options:**
  - `TextCard` now includes additional properties:
    - `size`: Easily specify font size for individual text elements.
    - `weight`: Specify font weight (e.g., `'300'`, `'700'`).
    - `color`: Set specific colors for text elements.
    > Example:
    > ```typescript
    > mainText: { content: 'Hello World', font: 'Roboto', size: 40, weight: '700', color: '#FF5733' };
    > ```

- **Updated Builders:**
  - Added fine-grained control for font properties (`size`, `weight`, `color`) across all card builders.
  - Example usage for `BaseCardBuilder`:
    ```typescript
    const canvas = await new BaseCardBuilder({
      mainText: { content: 'HELLO', font: 'Roboto', size: 48, weight: '800', color: '#FF0000' },
      nicknameText: { content: 'User', font: 'Roboto', size: 35, weight: '700' },
    }).build();
    ```

### ðŸ“– Documentation:

- Updated README:
  - Added detailed examples for `loadFont` and `loadFonts` usage.
  - Highlighted the removal of preloaded fonts and how to use the new font-loading utilities.
  - Included examples for the new `TextCard` properties (`size`, `weight`, `color`).
  - Improved instructions for creating rank, welcome, and info cards with custom fonts and styles.

### ðŸ›  Dependencies:

- Updated `canvas` from `2.10.2` to `2.11.2`.
- Updated `@types/node` from `20.6.3` to `22.10.0`.
- Updated `typescript` from `5.2.2` to `5.7.2`.
- Updated `rimraf` from `5.0.5` to `6.0.1`.

### ðŸ”– Additional Notes:

- If you previously relied on the preloaded fonts, you must now register your own fonts using `loadFont` or `loadFonts`.
- This update significantly reduces the size of the library, making it faster and more efficient.
- The new `TextCard` properties (`size`, `weight`, `color`) offer unparalleled customization options for text rendering in your cards.
